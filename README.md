This is a small R Shiny Application that helps in calculating the grantham score for substitution of a nucleotide in a sequence.

## Functionality

This application is planned to have the following functionality.

* Direct Amino Acid/Amino Acid score
* Summed score of changes in Amino Acid Sequences
* Summed score of all 6 ORFs of a given DNA Sequence

## Current Status

This application currently only allows for direct score comparisons and has an elementary output. Better interface and more functionality is planned.
